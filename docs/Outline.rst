This project is designed to study supernova light curves and estimate characteristics leading to understanding their peak intrinsic brightnesses. The methods of doing these have been devised and practised for a couple of decades now.  But we want to do this for the most modern datasets which are (a) large and (b) different in that they have better photometry (light curves) don't have spectra. 

Traditionally, light curves have been used to estimate the intrinsic brightness of supernovae Type Ia, whereas spectra are used (a) to obtain 'redshift' of the supernovae, which tells you how much expansion of the universe has happened since the supernova exploded and (b) Classify the type of SN and confirm that they are Type Ia. 

In the absence of spectra, we will be using light curves to also do these two functions. In particular, during this project, we will work on obtaining redshift
from these light curves. The goals of this project would be to use our existing tools to
- Build Statistics of how well these do in obtaining redshift
- Try to understand the cause of 'failures' if significant.
